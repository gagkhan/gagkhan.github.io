MPC with iLQG has been shown to be fast and effective for generating trajectories to reach a goal. However, when optimizing for non-linear dynamics, it runs the risk of falling into local minima. Unlike iLQG, Sampling Based Planning (SBP) methods such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) can be robust to local minima because they explore by taking random actions instead of following a gradient. However, for similar reasons, SBP often produces inefficient trajectories. We combine these two approaches; using an RRT-produced trajectory as a warm start for iLQG, we can overcome local minima while still producing an efficient trajectory

In this paper, we use Model Predictive Control (MPC) with iLQR to automatically generate effective locomotion gaits via trajectory optimization. An important advantage of our method is that it can be applied to generate gaits under different environment dynamics such as dry friction or viscous friction while also enabling obstacle avoidance.

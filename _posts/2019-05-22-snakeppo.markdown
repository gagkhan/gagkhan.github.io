In this work, we study the use of deep reinforcement learning for control of snake robots. While prior work on control of snake robots primarily uses open loop control backed by sinusoidal gaits (serpenoid curves), we demonstrate the use of deep reinforcement learning (PPO) for generating snake gaits under different environments. We also compare our method with other classes - model predictive control (MPC) and sampling based planning (SPB). Our results show that the gaits generated by model-free deep reinforcement learning are comparable (sometimes better) to MPC in terms of efficiency and energy comsumption.
